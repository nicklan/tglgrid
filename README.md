A tglgrid is a grid of cells that can each be toggled on and off.  It
can be instantiated with different dimensions depending on your
project's needs.

You can bang the left input to output a list of the active cells in
the currently active column and send a column number to the right input
to select the active column.

It's probably easier to just look at this screenshot:

The included help patch should explain things thoroughly as well.
